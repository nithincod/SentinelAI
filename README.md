## Overview ü§ñ

The project aims to develop a system for violence detection using CCTV footage and providing an immediate alert to the police. The system will use advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the CCTV footage in real-time and detect any violent behavior or actions. Once detected, an automatic alert will be sent to the police, enabling them to respond quickly and take appropriate action. The system has the potential to enhance public sa# SenitelAI

## üìå Project Overview

**SenitelAI** is an AI-powered violence detection system designed to monitor CCTV footage or camera feeds in real-time, detecting suspicious or violent activities and promptly sending alerts to relevant authorities. Leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, this solution aims to enhance public safety and enable swift incident response.

The system can detect physical violence, weapon-related threats, and thefts, ensuring authorities are alerted immediately with precise timestamps and location details, reducing risks and improving crime prevention in public spaces.

## Usage

To use this project, you need to have a webcam connected to your computer. The project will capture the video stream from the webcam and analyze it for any violent activities. If any violence is detected, the project will send an alert to the respective authorities with the location and timestamp of the incident.

## Features ü¶æ

- Weapon Detection and Theft detection
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Enhance the user experience creating highly reactive website.
